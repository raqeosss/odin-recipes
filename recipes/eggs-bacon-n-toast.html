    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We're pretty sure you must have had Eggs and Bacon <strong>at least</strong> a couple of times, and we know nothing beats a classic dish, so today you are invited not to reinvent the wheel, but to try to spin it differently, you are invited to play with texture and heat.</p>
    
    <h3>Info</h3>
    <p>Will be ready in: 20 minutes</p>
    <p>Utensils required: Pan, Spatula</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>4 strips of bacon</li>
        <li>2 slices of bread</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Odin's <a href="./pesto.html">Brazilian Pesto</a> (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fry the bacon strips at low heat on a pan. You can use a little bit of butter or olive oil for this step if you think your pan will stick, but overall — specially if you are using non-stick pans or stainless steel pans — it is not needed.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, crack the eggs in a cup, salt them and mix them with a fork or a whisk. Keep an eye on the bacons trips, not letting them stick or burn, and flipping them once in a while. When they are nicely browned and caramelized, put them in a plate. <strong>Do not</strong> remove the bacon's oil from the pan, as it'll be needed for the toasts and eggs.</li>
        <li>With the pan on medium heat, toast both sides of the bread slices until they are a bit crisp on the outside. Put them aside on a plate along the bacon.</li>
        <li>Lastly, it's time for the eggs. If you still have a bit of that bacon oil, you can go ahead and pour the salted eggs into the pan on low heat. If your pan is already dry, you can use a little bit of butter or olive oil instead.</li>
        <li>For this step, it's mandatory that you pay close attention to the eggs. You should keep mixing them around the pan with a spatula or a spoon non-stop, and avoid the egg to cook too much or stick to the pan. It will cook slowly and when they start losing a bit of the egg's wet "shine", you should not cook them further. The result should be shiny and creamy, but not raw at all.</li>
        <li>Assemble it all together, and there you have it! If you <strong>still</strong> want to spice things up a little, try our <a href="./pesto.html">Brazilian Pesto</a> as a spread for the toasts.</li>
    </ol>
